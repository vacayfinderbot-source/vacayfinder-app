    Hi! I’m **Daksh Dave**, a 13-year-old who built VacayFinder with love 💻✨  
    This idea came from one of my own vacation experiences in **Amarillo, Texas**, where I realized how fun — but tricky — it can be to find the *perfect* place to stay.
    
    With a little help from my parents, **Parul Mehta** and **Utkarsh Dave**, I designed this app to make vacation planning simpler, faster, and more fun! 🌴
    
    Thanks for checking it out — and get ready for your next great getaway! 🚀
